# LFFfile
 Needed to create a new repo

This repository was created since my previous repository had a large file stuck in the commit history and I was not able to remove it. The LFS branch was being ruined and disturbed so it felt cleaner to create a new repo and push the LFS file through it. Rest assured, I have pushed the LFS file successfuly in this repository and know how to use that command. The steps are mentioned in the previous (main) repo for the Question 2.
